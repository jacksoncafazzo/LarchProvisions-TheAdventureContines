                <h2>EMILY CAFAZZO</h2>
                <p class="about emily">Emily is an Oregon native and professional chef, with 12 years experience cooking in some of Portland and New York’s best kitchens (Beast, Toro Bravo, Roberta’s and Blanca). Raised in Corvallis, Emily grew up working closely with her mother Kathy at a wholesale plant nursery in nearby Albany. It was there at the nursery, and in her family’s home garden that Emily came to understand delicious food as a product of quality ingredients. As an adolescent, her love for travel and dining introduced her to new food cultures and exotic cuisines around the globe, where she fell deeply in love with restaurants and hospitality at a young age. From Western Culinary Institute graduate (2003) to Iron Chef America contestant (Beast, 2010) - Emily’s culinary trajectory has found her leading the kitchens of some of Portland’s best chefs and restaurateurs; including Gabe Rucker and Naomi Pomeroy, Tommy Habetz, John Gorham, Troy McClarty, and more. Emily is currently finishing her last days of employment as the Chef de Cuisine at Cyril’s at Clay Pigeon Winery. She is inspired by local ingredients, seasonal vegetables and farm produce, and specializes in pastry, pies, and cakes.</p>
